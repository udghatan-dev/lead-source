/**
 * Centralized documentation config for all lead sources.
 *
 * Each key matches a source's `key` from allSources.
 * Each entry contains:
 *   - title:       Guide heading
 *   - description: Brief overview
 *   - videoUrl:    (optional) YouTube embed URL
 *   - steps:       Array of { title, description, image?, tip? }
 *   - features:    Array of feature strings shown at the bottom
 *
 * Images: Use relative paths from /assets/docs/ or full URLs.
 *         Set image to null if not yet available — the step renders without it.
 *
 * To add docs for a new source, add a new key here. No component changes needed.
